# AWS Repository

This repository has been setup as a submodule of the main repository, available [here](https://github.com/Diegovano/BalanceBug23).

The AWS server will (if it is running) upon a push action which updates the remote, pull to ensure it has always got the up-to-date main.

Not sure what will happen if someone pushes to this repo while the server is running files though :|
